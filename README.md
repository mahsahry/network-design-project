# Network Design & Simulation (Cisco Packet Tracer)

This repository contains a complete network topology design built in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

## Contents

- **`network_design_project.pkt`** – full Packet Tracer simulation file  
- **`network_design_report.pdf`** – detailed written report including:
  - network diagrams
  - IP addressing and subnetting plan
  - routing and switching configuration
  - design rationale and assumptions
  - basic security considerations

## Skills Demonstrated

- VLAN design and trunk configuration  
- Static and/or dynamic routing  
- IP addressing and subnetting  
- Switch and router configuration  
- End-to-end connectivity testing (ping, traceroute, etc.)  
- Applying basic network security policies (e.g., segmentation, access control)

## How to Open the Project

1. Install **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
2. Open the file:
